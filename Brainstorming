Ok so I'm just doing some brainstorming, and trying to get ideas actually written down

We want to take information from Polaris' JSON file, and use that data to print trip information onto a map.

My thought (and it's cool if this isn't the idea others have, I'm not sold) is to make a map that Polaris could, say, put onto their website homepage.  
Basically, it would be a world map, with the trip information displaying where people have ventured in a Polaris vehicle.  

The map will be courtosy of Google

What are others thinking?


Via Polaris' website:
Our vision is to fuel the passion of riders, workers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world by delivering innovative, high-quality vehicles, products, services and experiences that enrich their lives.

Polaris Adventures
Desert Oaisis, Forrested Trails, Mountain Passes, Scenic Highways, Snowy Routes

psedocode for categorization
If (Speed > 40 mph), it is Highway
ELSE if (altitude > 100 m above sea level), it is Mountain
ELSE if (latitude is at the poles), it is Snowy
ELSE if (latitude is at the equator), it is desert
ELSE, it is a forrested trail


How to make lines across the map

[coord 1, coord 1], [coord 2, coord 2], ... until we have done all coords for a specific user ID.  Then move on to next "line"
Set line color by the adventure category
See if we can do something to even out curves to make it look less choppy (maybe find the path with least altitude change between each coord?  Using Google's eleveation API)
