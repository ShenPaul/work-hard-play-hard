Ok so I'm just doing some brainstorming, and trying to get ideas actually written down

We want to take information from Polaris' JSON file, and use that data to print trip information onto a map.

My thought (and it's cool if this isn't the idea others have, I'm not sold) is to make a map that Polaris could, say, put onto their website homepage.  
Basically, it would be a world map, with the trip information displaying where people have ventured in a Polaris vehicle.  

The map will be courtosy of Google

What are others thinking?
